Condition Variables and Semaphores
    - One step ahead of mutexes
    - how many concurrent goroutines can execute to a section at a time
    - It gives use extra control to wait for certain condition before unblocking the execution



Pain Point of Conditional Variables with mutexes

The signal sent from cond.Signal() may be missed if:
    The goroutine sends the signal before the main goroutine enters cond.Wait().

This is because Wait() does not queue up events â€” it only blocks if it's already waiting. 
If the signal is sent before it starts waiting, the signal is lost and it will block forever.

So the thing here is, when i continuously spawn new go routine, it would signal, even 
before the main goroutine is waiting...

This makes, the goroutine throw signal but no ones waiting. This makes the signal go missing
and main go routine would be waiting in vain. This arises condition called deadlock.

deadlock => waiting forever
