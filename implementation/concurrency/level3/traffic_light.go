/*
7. Traffic Light Controller
You have 3 lanes: red, yellow, green. Only one can be active at a time.

Change light every 2 seconds in a loop.
Multiple goroutines may be waiting for green to proceed.
Ensure only green allows passing.

âœ… Use sync.Cond for coordination
âœ… Use shared state to represent the current light
*/

Light: green
 pass => goroutine


Light red
	red: Waiting for green
Light Yellow
	yellow: waiting for green
Light Green
	green: proceed

/*

Here's multiple goroutines are said to be waited. So, if i used Signal() , it would only wake only one
waiting goroutine.
Since, multiple go routines would be waiting for the signal to be green. i need to use broadcast.
