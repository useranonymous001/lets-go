/*
ðŸ§  Level 4: Simulate System-like Behavior
8. Elevator Controller
Simulate an elevator system:

5 floors

Goroutines simulate passengers requesting floors

Elevator moves between floors, picking up and dropping off

Handle concurrent requests without deadlocks

âœ… Use mutexes and condition variables to model movement and wait logic
*/

/*
Elelvator will be a single goroutine (loop)

passengers multiple goroutines (request Elevator goroutine)

*/

/*
This programs contains deadlock, since the elvator keep moving everytime and would be waiting for signals (request)
from the passengers, but we have very limited passengers. So, even after the elevator completes its tasks.
it keep moving and waiting for passenger, which is never there.
